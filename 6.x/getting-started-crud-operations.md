# 2. CRUD Operations

---

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Let's bring back the example in our first lesson. The Tags CRUD:

![Tag CRUD - List Entries Operation](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/docs-4-0/getting_started/tag_crud_list_entries.png)

With its ```TagCrudController```:

```php
<?php namespace App\Http\Controllers\Admin;

use Backpack\CRUD\app\Http\Controllers\CrudController;
use App\Http\Requests\TagCrudRequest;

class TagCrudController extends CrudController {

  use \Backpack\CRUD\app\Http\Controllers\Operations\ListOperation;
  use \Backpack\CRUD\app\Http\Controllers\Operations\ShowOperation;
  use \Backpack\CRUD\app\Http\Controllers\Operations\CreateOperation;
  use \Backpack\CRUD\app\Http\Controllers\Operations\UpdateOperation;
  use \Backpack\CRUD\app\Http\Controllers\Operations\DeleteOperation;

  public function setup()
  {
      CRUD::setModel('App\Models\Tag');
      CRUD::setRoute('admin/tag');
      CRUD::setEntityNameStrings('tag', 'tags');
  }

  public function setupListOperation()
  {
      CRUD::setColumns(['name', 'slug']);
  }

  public function setupCreateOperation()
  {
      CRUD::setValidation(TagCrudRequest::class);

      CRUD::field('name');
      CRUD::field('name')->type('text')->label('URL Segment (slug)');
  }

  public function setupUpdateOperation()
  {
      $this->setupCreateOperation();
  }
}
```

In the example above, we've enabled the most common operations:
- **Create** - using a create form (aka "*add form*")
- **List** - using AJAX DataTables (aka "*list view*", aka "*table view*")
- **Update** - using an update form (aka "*edit form*")
- **Delete** - using a *button* in the *list view*
- **Show** - using a *button* in the *list view*

These are the basic operations an admin can execute on an Eloquent model, thanks to Backpack. We do have additional operations (Reorder, Revisions, Clone, BulkDelete, BulkClone), and you can easily _create a custom operation_, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Baby steps. **Let's go through the most important features of the operations you'll be using _all the time_: List, Create and Update**.

<a name="create-and-update-operations"></a>
## Create & Update Operations

![Tag CRUD - Edit Operation](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/docs-4-0/getting_started/tag_crud_edit.png)

<a name="fields"></a>
### Fields

Inside your Controller's ```setupCreateOperation()``` or ```setupUpdateOperation()``` method, you'll be able to define what fields you want the admin to see, when creating/updating entries. In the example above, we only have two fields, both using the ```text``` field type. So that's what's shown to the admin. When the admin presses _Save_, assuming your model has those two attributes as ```$fillable```, Backpack will save the entry and take you back to the List view. Keep in mind we're using a _pure_ Eloquent model. So of course, inside the model you could use accessors, mutators, events, etc.


But a lot of times, you won't just need text inputs. You'll need datepickers, upload buttons, 1-n relationship, n-n relationships, textareas, etc. For each field, you only need to define it properly in the Controller. Here are the most used methods to manipulate fields:

```php
CRUD::field('price');
CRUD::field('price')->prefix('$'); // set the "prefix" attribute to "$"
CRUD::field('price')->remove(); // delete a field from the form
CRUD::field('price')->after('name'); // move a field after a different field

// you can of course chain these calls:
CRUD::field('price')->label('Product price')->prefix('$')->after('name');

// you can also add multiple attribute in one go, by creating
// a field using an array, instead of just its name (a string);
// we call this the array syntax:
CRUD::field([
  'name' => 'price',
  'type' => 'number',
  'label' => 'Product price',
  'prefix' => '$',
]);
```

A typical *field definition* will need at least three things:
- ```name``` - the attribute (column in the database), which will also become the name of the input;
- ```type``` - the kind of field we'd like to use (text, number, select2, etc);
- ```label``` - the human-readable label for the input (will be generated from ```name``` if not given);


You can use [one of the 44+ field types we've provided](/docs/{{version}}/crud-fields#default-field-types), or easily [create a custom field type](/docs/{{version}}/crud-fields#creating-a-custom-field-type) if you have some super-specific need that we haven't covered yet, or even [overwrite how a field type works](#overwriting-default-field-types). Take a few minutes and [browse the 44+ field types](/docs/{{version}}/crud-fields#default-field-types), to understand how the definition array differs from one to another and how many use cases you have already covered.

Let's take another example, slightly more complicated than the ```text``` fields we used above. Something you'll encounter all the time is relationship fields. So let's say the ```Tag``` model has an **n-n relationship** with an Article model:

```php
    public function articles()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany('App\Models\Article', 'article_tag');
    }
```

We could use the code below to add a ```select2_multiple``` field to the Tag update forms:

```php
CRUD::field([
    'type' => 'select2_multiple',
    'name' => 'articles', // the relationship name in your Model
    'entity' => 'articles', // the relationship name in your Model
    'attribute' => 'title', // attribute on Article that is shown to admin
    'pivot' => true, // on create&update, do you need to add/delete pivot table entries?
]);
```

**Notes:**
- If we call this inside ```setupUpdateOperation()``` it will only be added on that operation;
- Because we haven't specified a ```label```, Backpack will take the "_articles_" name and turn it into a label: "_Articles_";

If we had an Articles CRUD, and the reverse relationship defined on the ```Article``` model too, we could also add a ```select2_multiple``` field in the Article CRUD, to allow the admin to choose which tags apply to each article. This actually makes more sense than the above :-)

```php
CRUD::field([
    'label' => "Tags",
    'type' => 'select2_multiple',
    'name' => 'tags', // the method that defines the relationship in your Model
    'entity' => 'tags', // the method that defines the relationship in your Model
    'attribute' => 'name', // foreign key attribute that is shown to user
    'pivot' => true, // on create&update, do you need to add/delete pivot table entries?
]);
```

<a name="callbacks"></a>
### Callbacks

Developers coming from other CRUD systems will be looking for callbacks to run ```before_insert```, ```before_update```, ```after_insert```, ```after_update```. **There are no callbacks in Backpack**.

Remember that Backpack is using Eloquent models. That means you can do X when Y is happening, by using the [Laravel Eloquent model events](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent#events). For example, in your CrudController you can do:

```php
public function setup() {
    // this will get run for all operations that trigger the "deleting" model event
    // by default, that's the Delete operation
    Monster::deleting(function ($entry) {
        // TODO: delete that entry's files from the disk
    });

    // this will get run on all operations that trigger the "saving" model event
    // by default, that's the Create and Update operations
    Monster::saving(function ($entry) {
        // TODO: change one value to another or something
    });
}
```

Alternatively, if you do need to change how an operation does something... that's dead-simple too. The ```store()``` and ```update()``` code is inside a trait, so you can easily override that method, and call it inside your new method. For example, here's how we can do things before/after an item is saved in the Create operation:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers\Admin;

use Backpack\CRUD\app\Http\Controllers\CrudController;

class ProductCrudController extends CrudController
{
    use \Backpack\CRUD\app\Http\Controllers\Operations\CreateOperation { store as traitStore; }

    // ...

    public function store()
    {
      // do something before validation, before save, before everything
      $response = $this->traitStore();
      // do something after save
      return $response;
    }
}
```

>But before you do that, ask yourself - **_is this something that should be done when an entry is added/updated/deleted from the application, too_**? Not just the admin panel? If so, a better place for it would be the Model. Remember your Model is a pure Eloquent Model, so the cleanest way might be to use [Eloquent Event Observers](https://laravel.com/docs/6.0/eloquent#events) or [accessors and mutators](https://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent-mutators#accessors-and-mutators).

<a name="list-entries-operation"></a>
## List Operation

List shows the admin a table with all entries. On the front-end, the information is pulled using AJAX calls, and shown using DataTables. It's the most feature-packed operation in Backpack, but right now we're just going through the most important features you need to know about: columns, filters and buttons.

You should configure the List operation inside the ```setupListOperation()``` method.

<a name="columns"></a>
### Columns

Columns help you specify *which* attributes are shown in the table and *in which order*. **Their syntax is super-similar to fields**:

```php
CRUD::column($column_definition_array); // add a single column, at the end of the table
CRUD::column('price')->type('number');
CRUD::column('price')->type('number')->prefix('$');
CRUD::column('price')->after('name'); // move column after another column
CRUD::column('price')->remove(); // move column after another column

// bulk actions
CRUD::addColumns([$column_definition_array_1, $column_definition_array_2]); // add multiple columns, at the end of the table
CRUD::setColumns([$column_definition_array_1, $column_definition_array_2]); // make these the only columns in the table
CRUD::removeColumns(['column_name_1', 'column_name_2']); // remove an array of columns from the table
CRUD::setColumnsDetails(['column_1', 'column_2'], ['attribute' => 'value']);
```

You can use one of the [44+ column types](/docs/{{version}}/crud-columns#default-column-types) to show information to the user in the table, or easily [create a custom column type](/docs/{{version}}/crud-columns#creating-a-custom-column-type), if you have a super-specific need. Here's an example of using the methods above:

```php
CRUD::column([
    'name' => 'published_at',
    'type' => 'date',
    'label' => 'Publish_date',
]);

// PRO TIP: to quickly add a text column, just pass the name string instead of an array
CRUD::column('text'); // adds a text column, at the end of the stack
```

<a name="filters"></a>
### Filters

![Monster CRUD - List Entries Filters](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/docs-4-0/getting_started/backpack_filters.png)

Filters provide an easy way for the admin to well… _filter_ the List table. The syntax is very similar to Fields and Columns and you can use one of the [existing 8 filter types](/docs/{{version}}/crud-filters) or easily [create a custom filter](/docs/{{version}}/crud-filters#creating-custom-filters). Note that this is a PRO feature.

```php
CRUD::addFilter($options, $values, $filter_logic);
CRUD::removeFilter($name);
CRUD::removeAllFilters();
```

For more on this, check out the [filters documentation page](/docs/{{version}}/crud-filters), when you need them.

<a name="buttons"></a>
### Buttons

![Tag CRUD - List Entries Buttons](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/docs-4-0/getting_started/backpack_buttons.png)

If you want to add a custom button to an entry, you can do that. If you want to remove a button, you can also do that. Look for the [buttons documentation](/docs/{{version}}/crud-buttons) when you need it.

```php
// positions: 'beginning' and 'end'
// stacks: 'line', 'top', 'bottom'
// types: view, model_function
CRUD::addButton($stack, $name, $type, $content, $position);
CRUD::removeButton($name);
CRUD::removeButtonFromStack($name, $stack);
```

**That's it for today!** Thanks for sticking with us this long. This has been the most important and longest lesson.
