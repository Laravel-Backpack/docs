## About

A chips helps show the information of a database entry, in a format that takes up little space visually. It can be used anywhere you want, but it's particularly useful inside operations to:
- show more info inside a table cell in the **ListOperation**;
- show a related item in more detail in the **ShowOperation**;

A chip consists of only one file - a blade file with the same name as the chip type (ex: ```general.blade.php```). Backpack provides you with one chip type, that is very general (hence the name). This chip is designed to accomodate most types of database entries - but if your needs are more particular, you can easily [create an entirely new chip type](#creating-a-custom-chip-type).

#### General Chip

![Backpack v7 general chip](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/v7/general_chip.jpg)

This chip was designed to be so general, that it's useful to show _most_ types of entries from the database. The general chip has 3 sections: `heading`, `image` and `details`. All sections are optional. Each of those sections has one mandatory attribute, `content`. Any other attributes you specify on those sections will be placed on that DOM element.

Here's a very minimal usage of the general chip:

```php
@include('crud::chips.general', [
    'heading' => [
        'content' => 'John Doe',
    ],
    'image' => [
        'content' => asset('uploads/person1.jpg'),
    ],
    'details' => [
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-hashtag',
            'content' => '8AH13A7',
        ],
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-envelope',
            'content' => 'john.doe@example.com',
        ],
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-phone',
            'content' => '+1 (555) 123-4567',
        ]
    ]
])
```

But you can also specify more attributes, to enhance your chip with links, titles etc:

```php
@include('crud::chips.general', [
    'heading' => [
        'content' => 'John Doe',
        'href' => 'https://google.com',
        'target' => '_blank',
        'title' => 'Example of a chip without URL',
    ],
    'image' => [
        'content' => asset('uploads/person1.jpg'),
        'element' => 'a',
        'href' => 'https://chatgpt.com',
        'target' => '_blank',
        'title' => 'Image can have its own URL, but why?! Falls back to the one in the heading',
    ],
    'details' => [
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-hashtag',
            'content' => '8AH13A7',
            'url' => 'mailto:john.doe@example.com',
            'title' => 'Click to email',
        ],
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-envelope',
            'content' => 'john.doe@example.com',
            'url' => 'mailto:john.doe@example.com',
            'title' => 'Click to email',
        ],
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-phone',
            'content' => '+1 (555) 123-4567',
            'url' => 'tel:+15551234567',
            'title' => 'Click to call',
        ]
    ]
])
```

### How to use chips

Depending on _where_ you want to use a chip, there are a few ways you can do that. Remember - a chip is a simple blade file, so the methods below should be pretty intuitive:

<a name="how-to-use-a-chip-inside-a-custom-blade-view"></a>
#### How to use a chip inside a custom blade view

If you want to load a chip inside a custom page, custom component or anything else custom, you can just include the blade view directly, and pass whatever attributes you want to show. For example, if you want to use the `general` chip you can just include that blade file, and pass some of the variables it supports:

```php
{{-- Example of General chip for a person, with data from a User model --}}
@include('crud::chips.general', [
    'heading' => [
        'content' => $user->name,
        'href' => backpack_url('user/'.$user->id.'/show'),
        'title' => 'Click to preview',
    ],
    'image' => [
        'content' => backpack_avatar_url($user), // doesn't work well with dummy data
        'element' => 'a',
        'href' => backpack_url('user/'.$user->id.'/show'),
        'title' => 'Because of dummy data, this image is not available, but it would show a profile image',
    ],
    'details' => [
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-hashtag',
            'content' => $user->id,
            'url' => backpack_url('user/'.$user->id.'/show'),
            'title' => 'Click to preview',
        ],
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-envelope',
            'content' => $user->email,
            'url' => 'mailto:'.$user->email,
            'title' => 'Click to email',
        ],
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-calendar',
            'content' => $user->created_at->format('F j, Y'),
            'title' => 'Created at '.$user->created_at,
        ]
    ]
])
```

<a name="how-to-use-a-chip-as-a-datatable-column"></a>
#### How to use a chip as a datatable column

![Backpack v7 general chip in datatable component](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/v7/general_chip_in_datatable_component.jpg)

When your datatables have too many columns, chips become particularly useful. They allow you to compress the info from 5 or more columns... into a single chip column. This improves the UX of big datatables - your admins will no longer have to expand the table row or use horizontal scrolling to see crucial info.

Remember, a chip is just a simple blade file. So to use a chip as a column, we can just use the `view` column type, and pass the path to our chip file. For example:

```php
// after we create an `invoice` chip
// we can use that chip as a column:
CRUD::addColumn([
    'name' => 'info',
    'type' => 'view',
    'view' => 'crud::chips.invoice',
]);
```
By default, the view column type is not searchable. In order to make your chip columns searchable you need to [specify a custom ```searchLogic``` in your declaration](/docs/{{version}}/crud-columns#custom-search-logic).

#### How to use a chip as a widget

![Backpack v7 general chip as widget](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/v7/general_chip_as_widget.jpg)

Chip files usually only contain the minimum content and styling necessary. You can include them as widgets directly, but they probably won't look very pretty on a custom page, because they don't have a background, borders, shadow etc. That's why we've also created a `chip` widget, which adds wrappers just like the other widgets - so that your chip will look good when placed on a custom page (or an existing CRUD page, why not).

To use the `chip` widget, you can do:

```php
Widget::add()
    ->to('after_content') // optional
    ->type('chip')
    ->view('crud::chips.owner')
    ->title('Owner')
    ->entry($owner);
```

<a name="overwriting-default-chip-types"></a>
## Overwriting Default Chip Types

You can override a chip by create a file in ```resources\views\vendor\backpack\crud\chips``` with the same name. But it is NOT recommended to override the `general` chip type. When you do that, you're forfeiting any future updates for that chip. We can't push updates to a file that you're no longer using.

In 99.9% of the cases, it's recommended NOT to override the default `general` chip file, but to create a _custom_ chip file. That will make it a lot easier to upgrade to newer versions of Backpack - because the file is completely in your control.

<hr>

<a name="creating-a-custom-chip-type"></a>
## Creating a Custom Chip Type

Chips consist of only one file - a blade file with the same name as the chip type (ex: ```person.blade.php```). You can create one by placing a new blade file inside ```resources\views\vendor\backpack\crud\chips```. Be careful to choose a distinctive name - usually the model name works best.

To create a new chip file in the standard directory, you can run `php artisan backpack:chip {chip-file-name}`. This will create a new file in that directory, from a stub, for you to customize however you want.

For example, you can do `php artisan backpack:chip person` to create a ```person.blade.php``` then includes the HTML content directly:

```html
<div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-body">
        <div class="row align-items-center bp-chip">
            <div class="col-auto">
                <div class="d-block">
                    <a href="https://google.com" title="Example of a chip" target="_blank" class="d-inline-block"><span class="avatar avatar-2 rounded" style="background-image: url(http://bp-v7-alpha7.test/uploads/person1.jpg)"> </span></a>
                </div>
            </div>
        <div class="col text-truncate">
            <div class="d-block">
                <a href="https://google.com" class="mb-1 d-inline-block " title="Example of a chip without URL" target="_blank">
                    John Doe
                </a>
            </div>
            <div class="d-block text-secondary text-truncate mt-n1">
                <small class="d-inline-block me-1">
                    <i class="la la-hashtag" title="Click to email"></i>
                    <a href="mailto:john.doe@example.com" class="text-reset" title="Click to email">8AH13A7</a>
                </small>
                            <small class="d-inline-block me-1">
                    <i class="la la-envelope" title="Click to email"></i>
                    <a href="mailto:john.doe@example.com" class="text-reset" title="Click to email">john.doe@example.com</a>
                </small>
                            <small class="d-inline-block me-1">
                    <i class="la la-phone" title="Click to call"></i>
                    <a href="tel:+15551234567" class="text-reset" title="Click to call">+1 (555) 123-4567</a>
                </small>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

But most likely, you'll want to create a chip that outputs some information for a particular database entry. If you like how the `general` chip looks, and only want to make it easy to re-use the chip, you can create a chip that includes the `general` chip. For example:

```php
@php
    $last_purchase = $entry->invoices()->orderBy('issuance_date', 'DESC')->first()->issuance_date;
@endphp

@include('crud::chips.general', [
    'heading' => [
        'content' => 'Invoice '.$entry->series.' '.$entry->number.' - '.$entry->owner->name,
        'href' => backpack_url('pet-shop/invoice/'.$entry->id.'/show'),
    ],
    'details' => [
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-dollar',
            'content' => $entry->total,
            'title' => 'Total invoice amount $'.$entry->total,
        ],
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-tags',
            'content' => $entry->items->count().' items',
        ],
        [
            'icon' => 'la la-calendar',
            'content' => $last_purchase->format('F j, Y'),
            'title' => 'Issuance date: '.$last_purchase,
        ]
    ]
])

```

Otherwise, you can create a completely custom chip, that looks and works differently from the `general` chip. There are no limitations - since chips are simple blade files. Just copy-paste the HTML from the `general` chip and change it to match your needs. Or add completely different HTML - there are no limitations.
