# Blade Components

## About

[Blade components](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#components) are a quick way for you to output a bit of HTML... that can then be customized by each Backpack theme. It's a clean way of echoing theme-agnostic components, because for each Component that Backpack provides, the theme itself can customize and make it pretty in their own way.

<a name="how-to-use-components"></a>
### How to Use

Anywhere in your blade files, you can use the Blade components we have. But most likely you'll be using them in your `resources/views/vendor/backpack/ui/inc/menu_items.blade.php`, because all our components currently are concerned with outputting menu items in a theme-agnostic way.


<a name="mandatory-attributes"></a>
### Mandatory Attributes

There are no mandatory attributes.

<a name="optional-attributes"></a>
### Optional Attributes

All components also allow you to specify custom attributes. When you specify a custom attribute, that attribute will be placed on the most likely element of that component. In most cases, that is the anchor element. For example:

```php
<x-backpack::menu-item title="Tags" icon="la la-tag" :link="backpack_url('tags')" target="_blank" />
```

Even though the 'target' attribute doesn't _technically_ exist in the component, that attribute will be placed on that component's `a` element.

## UI Components

<a name="menu-item"></a>
### Menu Item

Shows a menu item, with the title and link you specify:

```php
<x-backpack::menu-item title="Tags" icon="la la-tag" :link="backpack_url('tags')" />
```

Note that you can further customize this using custom attributes. If you define a `target` on it, that will be passed down to the `a` element.

<hr>

<a name="menu-separator"></a>
### Menu Separator

Shows a menu separator, with the title you specify:

```php
<x-backpack::menu-separator title="Some text for separation" />
```

Note that you can further customize this using custom attributes. If you define a `class` on it, that will be passed down to the `li` element.

<hr>


<a name="menu-dropdown-and-menu-dropdown-item"></a>
### Menu Dropdown & Menu Dropdown Item

To show a dropdown menu, with elements, you can use the `menu-dropdown` and `menu-dropdown-item` components:

```php
<x-backpack::menu-dropdown title="Authentication" icon="la la-group">
    <x-backpack::menu-dropdown-item title="Users" icon="la la-user" :link="backpack_url('user')" />
    <x-backpack::menu-dropdown-item title="Roles" icon="la la-group" :link="backpack_url('role')" />
    <x-backpack::menu-dropdown-item title="Permissions" icon="la la-key" :link="backpack_url('permission')" />
</x-backpack::menu-dropdown>
```

Notes:
- on `menu-dropdown` you can define `nested="true"` to flag that dropdown as nested (aka. having a parent); so you can have dropdown in dropdown in dropdown;
- on both components, you can also define custom attributes; eg. if you define a `target` on one, that will be passed down to the `a` element;

## Data Components

These are the components that Backpack uses inside the default CRUD operations. Starting Backpack v7, they are exposed as components, so that you can also use them _outside_ the CrudControllers, or in your custom operations.


<a name="dataform"></a>
### Dataform

![Backpack v7 Dataform component](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/v7/dataform_component.jpg)

This component helps you show a form _anywhere you want_, so the admin can easily create or edit an entries for an Eloquent model. The dataform component is a extension of a CrudController - so a CrudController for that entity needs to be already set up, and passed to this component as a parameter:

```html
<x-bp-dataform controller="\App\Http\Controllers\Admin\InvoiceCrudController" />
```

**Configuration options:**
- `operation='create'` - by default, the datatable component will pick up everything that controller sets up for the Create operation; if you want to change the operation it will initialize, you can pass this parameter;
- `:entry="\App\Models\Invoice::find(1)"` - if you want to use UpdateOperation or a custom form operation that needs the entry;
- `:setup="function($crud, $parent) {}"` - if you want to make changes to the operation setup (eg. add/remove fields, configure functionality), you can use this parameter; the closure passed here will be run _after_ the setup of that operation had already completed;

**Advanced example:**

```html
<x-bp-dataform
    controller="\App\Http\Controllers\Admin\InvoiceCrudController"
    name="invoice_form"
    operation="update"
    :entry="\App\Models\Invoice::find(1)"
    :setup="function($crud, $parent) {
        $crud->removeColumn('notes');
    }"
 />
```

<a name="dataform-modal"></a>
### Dataform Modal

![Backpack v7 Dataform Modal component](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/v7/dataform_component.jpg)

This component helps you show a form _anywhere you want_ inside a modal, so the admin can easily create or edit an entry for an Eloquent model without having to refresh the whole page.

To use this component you are required to add `CreateInModalOperation` and/or `UpdateInModalOperation` in your CrudController. The dataform modal component is a extension of a CrudController - so a CrudController for that entity needs to be already set up, and passed to this component as a parameter:

First, in your CrudController, either remove `CreateOperation` in favor of `CreateInModalOperation`, or you can keep both operations. Having both of them is usefull if you want your ListOperation to still show the regular "Create" button, but you would like also to have the possibility to create this entity somewhere else in your application using a modal form. 

```php
use \Backpack\DataformModal\Http\Controllers\Operations\CreateInModalOperation;
```

```html
<x-bp-dataform-modal controller="\App\Http\Controllers\Admin\InvoiceCrudController" />
```

**Configuration options:**
- `operation='createInModal'` - by default, the component will pick up everything that controller sets up for the Create operation; if you want to change the operation it will initialize, you can pass this parameter, eg: `updateInModal`
- `:entry="\App\Models\Invoice::find(1)"` - if you want to use UpdateInModalOperation or a custom form operation that needs the entry;
- `:setup="function($crud, $parent) {}"` - if you want to make changes to the operation setup (eg. add/remove fields, configure functionality), you can use this parameter; the closure passed here will be run _after_ the setup of that operation had already completed;

**Advanced example:**

```html
<x-bp-dataform-modal
    controller="\App\Http\Controllers\Admin\InvoiceCrudController"
    name="invoice_form"
    operation="updateInModal"
    :entry="\App\Models\Invoice::find(1)"
    :setup="function($crud, $parent) {
        $crud->removeColumn('notes');
    }"
 />
```

> **NOTE**: The date_picker (jquery version) does not properly work in this context. Please use any alternative. 

<a name="datatable"></a>
### Datatable

![Backpack v7 Datatable component](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/v7/datatable_component.jpg)

Useful if you want to show the entries in the database, for an Eloquent model. This component shows a datatable _anywhere you want_, so the admin to easily list, filter, search and perform other operations on entries of an Eloquent model. The datatable component is a extension of a CrudController - so a CrudController for that entity needs to be already set up, and passed to this component as a parameter:

```html
<x-bp-datatable controller="\App\Http\Controllers\Admin\InvoiceCrudController" />
```

**Configuration options:**
- `name='invoices_datatable'` - by default, a name will be generated; but you can pick one you can recognize;
- `operation='list'` - by default, the datatable component will pick up everything that controller sets up for the List operation; if you want to change the operation it will initialize, you can pass this parameter;
- `:setup="function($crud, $parent) {}"` - if you want to make changes to the operation setup (eg. add/remove columns, configure functionality), you can use this parameter; the closure passed here will be run _after_ the setup of that operation had already completed;

**Advanced example:**

```html
<x-bp-datatable
    controller="\App\Http\Controllers\Admin\InvoiceCrudController"
    name="invoices"
    operation="show"
    :setup="function($crud, $parent) {
        if ($parent) {
            $crud->addClause('where', 'customer_id', $parent->id);
        }
    }"
 />
```

<a name="datagrid"></a>
### Datagrid

![Backpack v7 Datagrid component](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/v7/datagrid_component.jpg)

Useful if you want to show the attributes of an entry in the database (the attributes of an Eloquent model). This components shows a grid view with all attributes that are configured using CRUD columns.

There are two ways to use the Datagrid component:

#### Datagrid for an existing CrudController

Your datagrid will pick up the configuration in your CrudController automatically.


```html
<x-bp-datagrid
    controller="\App\Http\Controllers\Admin\InvoiceCrudController"
    :entry="\App\Models\Invoice::first()"
/>
```

**Configuration options:**
- `name='datagrid'` - by default, a name will be generated; but you can pick one you can recognize;
- `operation='show'` - by default, the datagrid component will pick up everything that controller sets up for the Show operation; if you want to change the operation it will initialize, you can pass this parameter;
- `:setup="function($crud, $entry) {}"` - if you want to make changes to the operation setup (eg. add/remove columns, configure functionality), you can use this parameter; the closure passed here will be run _after_ the setup of that operation had already completed;

**Advanced example:**

```html
<x-bp-datagrid
    controller="\App\Http\Controllers\Admin\PetShop\OwnerCrudController"
    operation="show"
    :entry="\App\Models\Owner::first()"
    :setup="function($crud, $entry) {
        $crud->removeButton('delete');

        Widget::collection()->get('pets_crud')?->remove();
        Widget::collection()->get('invoices_crud')?->remove();
    }"
/>
```

#### Datagrid for an Eloquent entry

If you want to show a datagrid component for a entity that does _not_ have a CrudController, you can do that too. But you have to manually specify the columns you want to be shown:

```html
<x-bp-datagrid
    :entry="\App\User::find(1)"
    :columns="[
        ['label' => 'Name', 'type' => 'text', 'name' => 'name', 'size' => 6],
        ['label' => 'Email', 'type' => 'email', 'name' => 'email', 'size' => 6],
        ['label' => 'Created At', 'type' => 'datetime', 'name' => 'created_at'],
        ['label' => 'Updated At', 'type' => 'datetime', 'name' => 'updated_at'],
    ]" />
```

<a name="datalist"></a>
### Datalist

![Backpack v7 Datalist component](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/v7/datalist_component.jpg)

Useful if you want to show the attributes of an entry in the database (the attributes of an Eloquent model). This components shows a table with all attributes that are configured using CRUD columns.

There are two ways to use the Datalist component:

#### Datalist for an existing CrudController

Your datalist will pick up the configuration in your CrudController automatically.


```html
<x-bp-datalist
    controller="\App\Http\Controllers\Admin\InvoiceCrudController"
    :entry="\App\Models\Invoice::first()"
/>
```

**Configuration options:**
- `name='invoices_datalist'` - by default, a name will be generated; but you can pick one you can recognize;
- `operation='show'` - by default, the datalist component will pick up everything that controller sets up for the Show operation; if you want to change the operation it will initialize, you can pass this parameter;
- `:setup="function($crud, $entry) {}"` - if you want to make changes to the operation setup (eg. add/remove columns, configure functionality), you can use this parameter; the closure passed here will be run _after_ the setup of that operation had already completed;

**Advanced example:**

```html
<x-bp-datalist
    controller="\App\Http\Controllers\Admin\PetShop\OwnerCrudController"
    operation="show"
    :entry="\App\Models\Owner::first()"
    :setup="function($crud, $entry) {
        $crud->removeButton('delete');

        Widget::collection()->get('pets_crud')?->remove();
        Widget::collection()->get('invoices_crud')?->remove();
    }"
/>
```

#### Datalist for an Eloquent entry

If you want to show a datalist component for a entity that does _not_ have a CrudController, you can do that too. But you have to manually specify the columns you want to be shown:

```html
<x-bp-datalist
    :entry="\App\User::find(1)"
    :columns="[
        ['label' => 'Name', 'type' => 'text', 'name' => 'name', 'size' => 6],
        ['label' => 'Email', 'type' => 'email', 'name' => 'email', 'size' => 6],
        ['label' => 'Created At', 'type' => 'datetime', 'name' => 'created_at'],
        ['label' => 'Updated At', 'type' => 'datetime', 'name' => 'updated_at'],
    ]" />
```


<hr>

<a name="syntaxes-for-using-components"></a>
## Syntaxes for Using Components

All components that Backpack provides are available to use both using the "full namespace" syntax:

```html
<x-backpack::datatable>
```

and using the slightly shorter "alias" syntax:

```html
<x-bp-datatable>
```

You can use whichever one you prefer. But please note that if you need to pass the components to a dynamic Laravel Blade component, only the "alias" syntax will work (eg. you will pass `:component='bp-datagrid'`). This is a limitation from Laravel, not Backpack.


<a name="overwriting-default-components"></a>
## Overriding Default Components

You can override a component by placing a file with the same name in your ```resources\views\vendor\backpack\ui\components``` directory. When a file is there, Backpack will pick that one up, instead of the one in the package.

>**Avoid doing this.** When you're overwriting a component, you're forfeiting any future updates for that component. We can't push updates to a file that you're no longer using.

<a name="creating-a-custom-component"></a>
## Creating a Custom Component

We do not support creating custom components within the `backpack` namespace. If you want to create a custom component, please create one in the `app` namespace. The [Laravel docs on Blade Components](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#components) will teach you everything you need to know.
